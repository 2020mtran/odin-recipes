            <li>20 Slices of Oven Roasted Turkey</li>
            <li>1 Package Sliced Swiss Cheese (You can substitute with 
                sliced Monterey Jack cheese.)</li>
            <li>1 Roma Tomato (Thinly Sliced)</li>
            <li>1 Large Avocado (Thinly Sliced)</li>
            <h3>Serve With:</h3>
            <li>Restaurant Style Salsa</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>On medium heat, pour in 1/2 a teaspoon of cooking oil into the pan. 
                Once the pan is warm, place in a flour tortilla and cook it for 1-2 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Cook the other side for 1 minute. Then transfer to a cutting board and allow 
                the tortilla to cool for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Spread the mayonaise onto the entire surface of the tortilla.</li>
            <li>Next lay 2 to 4 slices of the oven roasted turkey across the bottom of the tortilla. 
                I added 4 slices but you can use just 2 if you want.</li>
            <li>Then add either 1 or 2 slices of cheese. If you just want to use 1 slice of cheese then tear it 
                in half lengthwise and lay it across the tortilla . Otherwise if you want to use 2 slices of 
                cheese then just lay the two full slices across the tortilla.</li>
            <li>Add 2 slices of avocado.</li>
            <li>Add some of the mixed spring lettuce.</li>
            <li>Lastly add 3 slices of tomatoes.</li>
            <li>Then roll it up and cut it in half.</li>
            <li>Serve with some restaurant style salsa.</li>
        </ol>
