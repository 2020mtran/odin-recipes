            <li>3/4 Cup Pre-made Beef Broth <strong>OR</strong> use

                (<em>Optional:</em> You can also use shredded Italian Blend cheese or 
                any cheese of your choice.)</li>
            <li>Handful Cilantro for garnish <em>Optional</em></li>
            <h3>Serve With:</h3>
            <li>Garlic Toast</li>

            <h3>Note:</h3>
            <li>* If you like your pasta saucy, then do not cook the entire box of macaroni. 
                Instead only cook about 3 cups of it.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the macaroni according to the directions on the back of the box. 
                Don't forget to add salt to the water. ( I cooked my pasta for 9 minutes ). 
                Drain the pasta into a colander. There is no need to rinse it. 
                Just shake the colander to remove any excess water from the pasta. 
                Then dump the hot pasta into a baking pan with 3 tablespoons of butter. 
                Toss the pasta with the butter. The butter will prevent the pasta from 
                clumping together. Then set aside.</li>
            <li>Skip this step if you are going to be using pre-made beef broth. 
                If you are going to be making a beef broth from a bouillon cube then in 
                a bowl add 3/4 cup of water + 1 beef bouillon cube and microwave for 2 minutes. 
                Set it aside and let the cube dissolve .</li>
            <li>Next chop the garlic, green bell peppers and onion.</li>
            <li>In a skillet on Medium-High heat brown the beef. Break the beef into 
                smaller pieces. Drain the fat.</li>
            <li>Add the garlic, green bell peppers, onion and seasonings. Saute until the 
                onions turn translucent.</li>
            <li>Add the beef broth and let it come to a boil.</li>
            <li>Then add the tomato sauce, diced tomatoes and sugar. Then bring it back to a boil.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to Low. Cover and simmer for 15-20 minutes or until the sauce has 
                reduced and thicken to your desire. Stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Right before turning off the heat add the shredded cheese. Cover for 1 minute or until 
                the cheese is melted. Only add the cheese to the pan if you will be serving it immediately. 
                Otherwise if you decide to serve it a little later, then you can add some pasta to a dish, 
                pour some sauce over the pasta and give it a mix. Then add some shredded cheese and microwave 
                your plate for 1 minute and 30 seconds or until the cheese is melted.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle with black pepper.</li>
            <li>Garnish with chopped cilantro. <em>(Optional)</em></li>
            <li>Serve with Garlic Toast.</li>
        </ol>
